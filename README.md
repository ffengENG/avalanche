**Continual AI** is an open research community on the topic of Continual Learning and AI! :-)
We are building an open-source, collaborative wiki at [continualai.org](http://continualai.org) as well as creating a community of CL enthusiasts! Join us today **[on slack](https://continualai.herokuapp.com)**! :D

**Continual AI - Avalanche** is a comprehensive framework for Continual Learning Research. It aims at unifying a set of popular CL baselines, environments and benchmarks to help algorithm prototyping and experiment, with with flexibility,
reproducibility, efficiency and maintainability in mind. Avalanche will be based on three main modules: datasets/environments, CL baselines and evaluation metrics/protocols.
